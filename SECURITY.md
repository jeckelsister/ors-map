# Security Guidelines

## üîí Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables
- **API Keys**: All sensitive API keys are stored in environment variables
- **Git Protection**: `.env` files are excluded from version control
- **Example File**: `.env.example` provides template without actual secrets

### 2. Build Security
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production builds
- **Console Removal**: Development console statements removed in production
- **Minification**: Code is minified and obfuscated

### 3. HTTP Security Headers
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy restricts resource loading
- **XSS Protection**: Browser XSS protection enabled
- **Clickjacking**: X-Frame-Options prevents iframe embedding
- **MIME Sniffing**: X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME confusion
- **HSTS**: Strict Transport Security for HTTPS enforcement

### 4. Service Worker Security
- **HTTPS Only**: Only caches HTTPS resources
- **Domain Whitelist**: External requests limited to approved domains
- **Response Validation**: Only successful responses (200) are cached

### 5. Input Validation
- **Coordinate Validation**: Geographic coordinates are validated
- **HTML Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS
- **File Name Validation**: Uploaded/exported file names are sanitized
- **URL Validation**: External URLs are validated before use

### 6. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Timeout Configuration**: All HTTP requests have timeouts
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- **Response Validation**: API responses are validated before use

### 7. Dependency Security
- **Regular Audits**: Dependencies are regularly audited for vulnerabilities
- **Automated Checks**: GitHub Actions run security checks on each deployment
- **Version Management**: Dependencies are kept up to date

## üö® Security Considerations

### API Key Exposure
**Risk**: The OpenRouteService API key is visible in the client-side bundle.
**Mitigation**:
- Use API key restrictions (domain-based)
- Consider implementing a backend proxy for sensitive operations
- Monitor API key usage regularly

### External Dependencies
**Risk**: Third-party services (OpenStreetMap tiles, APIs) could be compromised.
**Mitigation**:
- Service Worker validates domains before caching
- CSP headers restrict resource loading
- Regular monitoring of external service status

### User Data
**Risk**: Location data and route information is processed client-side.
**Mitigation**:
- No persistent storage of sensitive location data
- Users are informed about data usage
- Local storage is cleared appropriately

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Run `npm run security:check`
- [ ] Verify no secrets in code
- [ ] Check dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Validate CSP headers
- [ ] Test security headers

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review security audit reports
- [ ] Monitor API key usage
- [ ] Check for new security best practices

### Incident Response
1. **Identify**: Monitor for unusual activity
2. **Contain**: Disable compromised API keys
3. **Assess**: Determine scope of impact
4. **Remediate**: Apply fixes and updates
5. **Learn**: Update security measures

## üìû Security Contacts

For security issues, please:
1. Do not create public issues
2. Contact repository maintainers directly
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for response
